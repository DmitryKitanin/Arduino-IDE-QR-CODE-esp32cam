![esp32cam](esp32cam.jpg)
Start recognising QR codes with esp32cam board in Arduino IDE now! Without any problems...

No complex setup, additonal libraries, HUGE SDK and other annoying things!

Just one file!

Install esp32cam stuff in ArduinoIDE - use Google for that :-)
Just clone this repo, open 

Arduino-IDE-QR-CODE-esp32cam.ino

in Arduino IDE, scroll it down to:

//YOUR CODE HERE!---------------------------------------------------------


And that's all!

You are ready to write your code!


Existing file is ready-to-go program to read QR CODES from esp32cam.
Feel free to modify it for your needs!



Based on https://github.com/alvarowolfx/ESP32QRCodeReader
It was hard to set up, so i decided to merge all in one file
and then publish it on GitHub!
